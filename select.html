        Ernesto "Che" Guevara (1928â€“1967) was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat, politician, and military theorist.
        He was a central figure in the Cuban Revolution and later a guerrilla leader in other parts of South America. His stylized image has become a globally recognized countercultural symbol of rebellion.<br>
        In 1967.

          Guevara's guerrilla group in Bolivia was cornered and he was captured by the Bolivian army, aided by CIA advisors.
        His remains were secretly buried, only to be discovered and reburied in Cuba in 1997.
        Despite the controversial aspects of his ideology and methods, Guevara is revered as a martyred hero by many leftists and his image remains a potent symbol of leftist radicalism and anti-imperialism
